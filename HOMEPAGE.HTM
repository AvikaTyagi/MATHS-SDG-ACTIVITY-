<P> THERE ARE SOO MANY FESTIVALS CELEBRATED IN INDIA. MY FAVOURITE FESTIVAL IS DIWALI. DIWALI WHICH IS KNOWN AS FESTIVAL OF LIGHTS  IS CELEBRATED IN MONTH OF OCTOBER OR NOVEMBER. WE ALL LOVE TO BURN CRACKERS AND WE MEET AUR RELATIVES WE EAT SOO MANY KINDS OF SWEETS. DIWALI  IS CELEBRATED BECAUSE ON THAT DAY LORD RAMA WINS RAVAN AND RETURN TO AYODHYA.
